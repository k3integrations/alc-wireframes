# Adventist Learning Community - Live Wireframes

This repository is meant to be a push-only GitHub Pages repository. The idea is that you clone the actual ALC Wireframes repo from the K3 git server, run the `gulp build` task, then switch over to your cloned copy of this repo, in the gh-pages branch, and wholesale replace all of the files from the dist directory generated by `gulp build`. Then forcibly push up the new files: `git push origin gh-pages -f`.
